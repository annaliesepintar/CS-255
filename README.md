## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? 
DriverPass is a cloud-based web application with the purpose of providing resources to improve customer's driving test scores. By providing online classes, practice tests, in person instruction, and driving time with an instructor through their system, DriverPass aims to have customer's more prepared for their exam.

## What did you do particularly well?
I feel like I did a good just describing the system through different diagrams. My diagrams are simple, easy to read, but still represent the requirments for the system,

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the written descriptions of requirements. I would add more detail into my all of my decisions, especially my technical requirments and non-functional requirments.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The users needed an easy to use, simple platform, that gave them access only to the things required for their role. My design limited access depending on roles to increase security and keep the system easy and digestible for the user. It is important to consider user needs when designing applications because in the end of the day, the people actually using the product will be deciding if the product is any good or not. If the product does not meet the users needs, it does not matter if you met all of the clients requirments because there will be nobody using the application.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software by thinking about the different ways the software can be described. It can be described by how the data flows through the different processes. It can also be described by the different objects and there relationships. By doing this, I can identify the different components of the product and decide on the different functions I will need. In the future, I will utilize several of the different diagrams to plan, especially data flow diagrams and UML class diagrams.
